pina (Persephone, called also Κορῆ, tlte maidcn), stolen irom her
sight by the king of the lower world, and only restored to her by
Jupiter lor six months os each year. By this parable the ancients
understood the annual sowing of the grain-harvest, by which the
corn is hidden in the ground through the winter months, but re
stored in spring to sunlight, and ripening to the harvest, in which
