'ibe tale of Perseus (like that of Hercules and many other
heroes) represents the daily course ofthe sun, in conflict with the
powers of darkness and storm. The harpe is his gleaming ray;
the Graiae are the twilight; the Gorgons are the stom-cloud,
which rests upon the bosom of the sea-wave, and is cloven hythe
“golden sword ” oi the lightning. The jagged edges of the cloud,
and the crimson stream which pours from it in the glow of sunset‚
help out the features of the image.
