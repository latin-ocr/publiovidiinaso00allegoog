Messes. erw Bnornnns:

Guurturrnwf—Now thet you heve puhlished the complete introductory
Latin course of Messes. Allen und Greenongh, 1 sm glad to heve en oppor-
tunity of soyiug of it as e wholo whet I have elreedy said of the Grammar
und the editions of Caesar, Sallust, Cicero and virgil, es eaoh appeared,-
thut it is by fer the hest series ol the kind thet Iheve ever hed the oppor-
tunity ol exemining. A boy who follows the eourse of study which it
marks out for him will not only luy firm foundations, but also go fur towards
gaining un ample knowledge of the philology, the history, eud tho literature
ol the Latin leugnege. His efter-work will not obligo hin to unleurn uuy·
thing that he hes been tergun eud hs will be nbls to apply general prin- -
eiples to illustrate his luter studies. Itis pleasant to know thot the series
is so well apprecieted, eud 1 oougrotulete both you eud the authors on your
sueoees.

emur, April 29th, 1874.

Alter using, with, clusses, both Herkuess' end Andrews und Stoddurd’s ·

Latin Gratumurs‚1 examinod eurefully Allen and Greenough's Latin
Grammar. The syntax is musterly. The work, in ull its parts, gives the
results of the latest resosrches in comparative grammar. The hook is eom·
plets, without useless detail.

For thepast yearI have used this Grummer 'und Leighton's Lossons,
und with greater satisfaction than Ι heve kuowu in the use of any other
'grammar or book of exeroises in Lutin. Imost heertily reoommeud them
to all eureful instructors iu academies and preparatory sehools.

Ioasuhsequewl Letterheodds:

The longor end more thoroughly we use Goodwin’s end Allon und Green·
ough's‚ the more deeply we ere impressed with their espeeiul and remark·
uhle litness for the work of e oureful preparatory elussieul school.

· college.

Mnssns. Gnrw Buornnns:

anntnunw‚-I deum Allen end Greenough’s Latin Grammar un ed
mirahls book sor college use, end consider it superior to any other with
which 1 em acquainted. It is worthy of high proise. . . . I believe the gen·
eral introductiones this Grernmar iuro our schools and oolloges would be
a step forwerd towerd thorough end truly seioutilie instruction in the Lutin

lunguuge.
