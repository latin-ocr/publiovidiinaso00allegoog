[Boon V.-341-661.]

[Ar the marriage feast of Perseus and Andromeda, her uncle
Phineus, to whom she had been betrothed, out of jealousy caused
a quarrel among the guests; and a violent quarrel arising thence,
with bloodshed on both sideS, Perseus, by showing the Gorgon's
head, suddenly turned into stone Phineus himself, with two hundred ’
of his companions (V. 1-235). And by the same means, after his
return to ArgoS, his enemies Proetus and Polydectes were likewise
converted into stone (236-249). Minerva (who had attended Per·
seus thus far), coming to Helicon and inquiring of the Muses, is
Ι told the following: that having taken refuge from' a tempest with
Pyreneus of Daulia, in Phocis, and he offering them violence, they
were changed to birds, and he, attempting ssight after them, was
dashed in pieces (²50·²93)· The Pierides, daughters of ling
PieruS, of Macedonia, having challenged them toa trial of skill.
begin with the tale· of the gia'nt sons of Earth, who attempted to
scale Olympus; the terror of the gods before Typhoeus, and the ·
various shapes they assumed in their ssight3 to which the Muses⁷
respond by relating the Wandering of Ceres in her search for her
daughter Proserpine (294- 340)]

When the monster Typhoeus had been buried beneath Mount
AEtna, Pluto, god of the world below, alarmed at the convulsions
caused by his· agony‚ came forth to view. Now Venus had been
jealous at the virginity of Proserpine, Ceres' daughter ; and at her
bidding Cupid shot the king of Shadows with his dart. He then,
beholding Proserpine, as she sported with her maidens in the vale
of Enna, seized her, and bore her· away in his cha-riot, driving his
way through the fount of Cyane, who thereon was herself con-
verted into water (341-437). ι Seeking her daughter in vain, by the
light of torches kindled from AEtna, Ceres turned into a spotted
lizard (stellrh) the boy'Stelles, who had mocked her eager thirst3
and into a h'orned owl Ascalaphus, who testified to having seen
Proserpine in Hades eat seven pomegranate-seeds, wherehy she
was compelled to remain in her> new abode. Meanwhile, the
virgin-companions of Proserpine became winged 513303.Ι And,
by favor of Jupiter, Proserpine was permitted to pass half the year
with her mother, and half with her wedded lord (agis-Sisy). ·
