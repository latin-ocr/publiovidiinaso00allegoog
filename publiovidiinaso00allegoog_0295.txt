[Boou XIII.-750-897.]

[Duntrto the return of the chiefs from Troy, Hecuba, having
plucked out the eyes of Polymestor‚ king of Thrace, who had
murdered her son Polydorus, is changed to a dog (XIII. 399-575t
Aurora, mourning for her son Memnon, slain by Achilles, obtains
that his ashes shall become birds while her tears are changed to
dew (576-622). AEneas at Delphi is told by Anius, priest of
Apollo, of his daughters’ transformation into dores while fleeing
from the power of Agamemnon (623-674); and athis departing
receives from him a bowl engraved with the sels-devotion of Orion‘s
daughters, sacrificed for Thebes, out of whose ashes sprang the
youths Corona (675-699). Thence sailing to Crete and Italy, he
passes at Actium the stone image of the judge Ambracus, and
Dodona where the sons of Molossus took the form of birds
(700-718). On the coast of Sicily he nears the rock of the
monster Scylla, once the beautiful daughter of Phorcus, who hears
from her attendant nymph Galatea (daughter of Nereus and Doris)
the following tale (719—749).]

Acis, son of Faunus and the nymph Symaethia the most beau·
tiful youth of Sicily, loved and was loved by Galatea But the
giant Polyphemus had likewise conceived a wild passion for her,
which he utters in song (750-869); and seeing them as they are
seated together in a wood, he is filled with jealousy, and casts a
rock from AEtna upon them, by which Acis is crushed, and his
blood, oozing beneath the rock, becomes a river (870-897).

[Thereafter‚ as Scylla paces the shore, she is seen and pursued
by Glaucus, who relates to her the story of his own transformation
from a mortal to a sea-divinity (898-968). Going then to Circe. a
mistress of enchantments, he entreats her to aid his suit of Scylla;
but she in jealousy, because she herself loved Glaucus, so en-
chanted the waters Scylla used to bathe, that she was converted to
a foul monster, girt about the loins with wild dogs‚ and afterwards
(lest she might harm AEneas’ fleet) to a rock (XIV. 1-74).]

CIS erat Fauno nymphaque Symaethide cretus,
magna quidem patrisque sui matrisque voluptas,
nostra tamen major, nam me sibu iunxerat uni.
