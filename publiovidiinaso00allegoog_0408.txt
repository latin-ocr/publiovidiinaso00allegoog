Ia is supposed that most classes who read Ovid at all, will read
Ovid before any other Latin poet3 and as it is desirable that a
poetical composition should always be read as verse, -that is, with
a knowledge of its rhythmical structure,-a few directions will
here be given for scanning at sight, or by ear 3 which, with a little
practice, will be found an easy, almost mechanical process

lt is necessary, first, for the learner to understand the nature
of the verse, as depending on precisely the same principles as the
rhythmical divisions of a piece'of music (ξ 77); also, to be familiar
with the general rules of Quantity and Accent (ἕξ 3,‘4).* Besides
this, the teacher should explain and illustrate, so far as may be
necessary, the structure of the hexameter (ξ 82, a), reading from <
the text of the poem itself, until its peculiar movement has become
familiar to the leamer’s ear. lt will now be observed—

1. That the difficulties in scanning lie almost entirely in tlte
first balsos tlte verse. With very rare exceptions, the last two
feet, and generally the last three, are accented ln verse exactly as
they would be in prose: that is, the Arsls (first syllable) of the
foot corresponds with the natural or prose accent of the word.

2. That in hexameter verse tlte llelrelfool (rarely the fourth
instead) regularly begins wira tlte last syllable af a word. Thus,
while the last half of averse is almost always accented as in prose,
the first half very seldom is. The slight pause interrupting the
foot at the end of the word is called a casural pause (5 79, 5);
and is the most important point that distinguishes the movement
of verse from that of proser The pause in the third foot (less
commonly the fourth) usually corresponds with a pause in the
sense, and is called the principal caesura.

3That whenever a short syllable occurs in the verse, llere
mustea a dactyl. This becomes a most convenient rule, as soon
as the pronunciation of even the commonest words is known, in

‘To these it may be well to add the quantity of final syllables (ἦ 78, al. The
lamet should aleo be babituated to an accurate pronunciat'mn of words accordingto meu
