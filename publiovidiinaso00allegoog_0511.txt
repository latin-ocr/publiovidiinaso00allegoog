Messes. Grun Bnonnnns:

Gnnrununrr,-Haring used Goodwin's Greek Grammar, and Allen und
Greenough’s Latin Grammar, published by you, 1 take pleasuro in bearing
testimony to their superior merits as school books. For class instruction
they have, iu my opinion, no eounls. All tho necessary fects and principles
os tho Latin aud Greek Lungnngcs aro stated aud illustrated so plainly and
clearly, yet in so brief a orrnpass, thot studente will lind ererything easy 01
comprehension aud application, ond be relieved 11011 the unneeossary detail
found in niany school grammars.

. The “ Latin oud Greek Lessons,” by Prof. Leighton, are excollent eom·
panions 01 ¹these grammon, and will bc found containing ull thetis neces·
sary to prepare a student to read (lasaror Xenophon with ease. 1 lind
the other books 01 your Latin and Greek senes, namoly, Goodwin’s Greek
Rcader, Alleu’s Latin composition, Ailou aud Groenough’s Latin Selec-
tions and Cicero, exhibitiug all the accurate scholarship and thorough adep
tation to school work which we should expect from their distinguished
authors. ·

As publishers, you deservo not only great eredit 101Ι the judgmcut you
have displayed in the selection of your editorial corps, but also in tho uocu-
racy 01 the printing, 111 the general character 01 the mechanico] work.
