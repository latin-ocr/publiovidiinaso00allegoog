ACRISIUS, king of Argos, had been warned that he should be
dethroned and slain by the child of his daughter Danae, whom
therefore, to elude the oracle, he confined in a dungeon with brazen
walls. But Jupiter gained admission in the form of a shower of
gold, and Danae became the mother of Perseus. Being shut with ¹
the child — then four years of age - in a chest, or coffer, and cast
into the sea, she drifted to the island of Seriphus, where the boy
grew up, and was sent craftily by the tyrant of the island for the
head of the Gorgon Medusa. ln this enterprise he was helped
and delivered by the friendly care of the divinities Mercury and
Minerva, who armed him for his task, gave him the power of flight,
and made him invulnerable and invincible. (See, for an admirable
narrative of the adventure, Kingsley's “Heroes,'' and “Andro-
meda.'')
