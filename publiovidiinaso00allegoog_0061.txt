ΙΙ. THE Anvnnrunn on Palemon.

[Ardone the creatores generated from the soil of the earth after
the Deluge, had been the serpent Python, slain by Apono, who
thereon instituted the Pythian games: the prize of victory, first
the oak-leaf, was afterwards the laurel, sacred to Apollo, being the
nymph Daphne, loved by him, and changed to that form to escape
his pursuit.-Io, daughter of the river-god InachuS, beloved by
Jupiter, is changed into a heifer by him, to escape the jealousy of
Jun03 but is put by her in charge of Argus of the hundred eyes,
who being soothed to sleep by Mercury-who sings the story of
Syrinx converted to a water-reed to avoid the pursuit of Pan -.is ,
slain by him, and his hundred eyes are set in the peacock’s tail. .
Io, fleeing to Egypt, becomes the- goddess Isis, and the mother os
Epaphus ; who denies against Phaethon his boast to be son of the
Sua-god, as avouched by his mother Clymene (I. 416-779).]

The palace of the Sun described (ΙΙ. 1-18). Phoebus, the god 'of
Day, receives Phaethon with affection, and owns him as his son,
promising by oath to give him whatever boon he should desire¹
(19-46). Phaethon demands the charge of the chariot and horses os
the Sun for a single day, persisting in spite oi his father’s warning
and appeal (47-102). He mounts, and attempts the celestial way:
dread forms of the Zodiac: the steeds dash wildly from the path
, (¹03·205)· Terror and devastation caused by the fiery chariot:
blasting os mountains and rivers, and alarm of Neptune himself ; .
Earth appeals to Jupiter, who blasts Phaethon with a thunderbolt
(κού-324). His sisters are converted to poplarS, and their tears
,κ- to amber (325-366); while his kinsman Cygnus, bewailing the
· calamity, becomes a Swan (367—380).· The Sua, in grief and wrath, ·
hides his head from the earth3 but, entreated by the gods and
commanded by Jupiter, collects again his scattered steeds, to
resume their wonted eotrrse (381-400).
