X. 7.] Ι Orpheus and Eurydice.

XIV. Oueunus hun Euuvmcp.
[Boou X.-1-77.]

[Meuania mother of Hercules, to entertain Iole (who had
married his son Hyllus), relates the tale of Hercules' birth, which ·
was long delayed, but at last brought about by the artifice of Galan-
this, a waiting maid; who, for the falsehood she told, was turned

into a weasel by Ilithyia, whom she had deceived (IX. 273-323). ,

Iole relates in turn of her sister Dryope, changed to a lotus
(324-339). The restoring of lolaus to youth, and the miraculous
manhood bestowed on the children of Callirhoe, having moved the
displeasure os some of the gods, Jupiter reminds themoi the pain-
ful old age os his own son Minos (400-442). The tale is told of
Byblis, daughter of Miletus (who had migrated from Crete to Asia):
she, filled with a guilty love for her brother Caunus, became a foun-
tain in Caria (443-665). lphis, daughter of Ligdus of Crete, having
been brought up as a youth to avoid her father's displeasure that a
daughter was born to him, was at length changed to a young man
' by Isis, and so became the husband of Ianthe (666-797).]

Hymen, proceeding to Thrace, aiter the marriage of lphis,
unites Orpheus to Eurydice, but not happily‚ for she died from the
bite ol a serpent To recover her, Orpheus penetrated the shadows
of the Lower World‚ where even the Furies are moved to tears at
song, the torments of hell are stayed‚ and Proserpine' rs won to
yield him back his wife, only on condition that he shall not look
behind him till again in the upper world. Turning about too soon,
in his eagerness to see her, he loses her again, and' rs not suffered
a second time to enter Hades (X 1 -.77)

INDE per immensum croceo velatus amictu
aethera digreditur, Ciconumque Hymenaeus ad

oras
tendit, et Orphea nequiquam voce vocatur.
adfuit ille quidem; sed nec sollemnia verba,
nec laetos vultus, nec selix attulit omen. 5
sax quoque, quam tenuit, lacrimoso stridula sumo
usoue suit, nullosque invenit motibus ignes.
