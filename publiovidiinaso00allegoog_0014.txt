NOTE.

Tffls Selection follows generally the text of Merkel (1856), the
reading of Siebelis being preferred in one or two instances. We

have endeavored to exhibit as far as possible within our limlts the

variety os Ovid's style and genius, and especially to preserve the
more interesting biographical hints of the Amores and the Tristia.
The greater portion ot' the book is however made up, necessarily,
from the Metamorphoses, os which we have taken about a third.
By help os the Argument‚ which is given in soll, we aim not merely
to show the connection of the tales and the ingenuity os the transi·
tions‚-necessary to comprehend the poem as a whole‚-but to
pot before the reader something like a complete picture of the
Greek mythology; at least of those narratives which have held
their permanent place in the modern mind and have entered more '
or less into every modern literature.

The grammatical references are to Allen and Greenough’s and
Gildersleeve's Latin Grammars.
