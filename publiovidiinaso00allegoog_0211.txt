[Hencunes retur‘ning from the Calydonian Hunt‚ is entertained
with his friends by the river-god Achelous, who recounts the fate of
certain nymphs, turned into rocks and islands. These prodigies
are mocked by Pirithous, son of Ixion, who is among them. To
silence his cavil, Lelex relates the following tale (589-619).]

“ Jupiter and Mercury,joumeying once in Phrygia, were refused

hospitality by all the inhabitants ofa certain place, except two

pious rustics‚ Philemon and his wife Baucis, who provide such‘
entertainment as they are able (620-688). While the inhospitable

town was drowne'd iu a marsh‚ the poor hut of Philemon became

a temple, of which he and his wife were made attendants ; until in

agood old age they were both transformed to trees, he to an oalt

and she to a linden (689-724).

tota domus duo sunt, idem parentque jubentque.

Ergo ubi caelicolae parvos tetigere penates,
summissoque humiles intrarunt vertice postes,
membra senex posito jussit relevare sedili,
