Gauranum-In ncknowledging the reoeipt from you oia copy of Allen
and Greenough’s Virgil, allow me to express my appreciation of its supe·-
rior merite as a text-book. Ihave been particularly plensed with the Intro· v
ductions to the Bucolies aud the AEneid, end the good judgment und taste
exhibited in the notes, which in their rendering ni many passages so well
illustrate what the editors themselves recall to the attention of the pupil,
thatin translating, poetry requires·“ a more precise, virid, end picturasque

nse oi words than prose.’'

Garunnam-I have examined Allen end Greenough'e Cicero with some
cere. It seems t'o he a worthy volume of the beautiful series of classica
which yon are giving to American studente. The hiswrical notes and*
explanatione of technicnl points are excellent, and so clear as to be easily
vemombered. 1 propose to use the book with 'my next Cicero pupils.

From H. Ι. Frieze, Professores Latin, Anu Arbor.

Ihave just received a oopy sent by yon of your “ Cicero's Selcct Orn-
tions,'' with which, on a first and hasty inspectior, Iam very much plensed.
Teachers preparing studente sor the University oi Michigan avo informod‘
that the Grammar and Latin Prose of Messrs. Allen and Greenongh will bd
regarded ns a lull equivalent ior any other Latin Grammar and Latin Prose
Composition hitherto employed in the preparatory course for this Univevsity.

Messes. Grvrv Baornnns:

Gnvetunrr,÷ntlen and Greenongh's Caesar was duly received, and has
hoen examined vvith pleasn're. It seems to mo one of the bestvolnmes of
your classica! series, and highly ereditsble, both to the editors oud the puh
lishers. The notes hove the same excellent characteristics which belong to
the notes ol preceding volumes of the series, and are sufficiently full.

I am greatly pleased with your edition of Virgil. The notes are of the
right kind. The translationem, are not merely accurate in pointel
scholarship, hut are also expressed in good, idiomatis English-an excel-³
lence much too rare. It is in every vray svery attractiva emersa.
