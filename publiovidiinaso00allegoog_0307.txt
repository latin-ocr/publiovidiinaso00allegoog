[AEunns had passed, on the coast of Italy, the isle of the Cer·
copes, turned by Jupiter into apes (XIV. 7 5-100), and coming to
Cumae, finds the Sibyl Amalthea, daughter ot' Scylla, who relates
that, being loved by Apollo, he had granted her wish to live so
many years as the grains of saud in her hand (ror-⁴153). Arriving
at Cajetas, he meets Macareus, an old companion ol Ulysses, who
relates the adventure of the Cyclops and the enchantments of
Circe, at whose palare they had remained a full year (1 xm·
During this time, Circe tells of Picus, son of saturn, wh ,not
returning her love, she had converted to a woodpecker, anO his
compauions to various beasts‚ while his wife Canens wasted into
air (313-440). In the wars which followed AEneas’ arrival in
Latium, Diomed refuses aid to Turnus, but his companions, desir-
ing to grant it, are changed to white hinds (441-511). Various
transformations follow: of the shepherd Apulus to a wild olive;
of AEneas’ ships to water-nymphs3 of the ashes of the city Ardea
to a heron; and at length of AEneas himself to one of the gods
Indrgctes,· of Tiberinus to a river; of Vertumnus to sundry shapes,
with the tales by which he at length won the love of Pomona; '
lastly of Romulus, who at his death became the god Quirinus, and
bis wife Hersilia the goddess Ora (512-851).]

Guided by an ancient sage, Numa seeks wisdom among the
Greeks of Southem Italy; [whereby violating the Sabine law, he
ls accused, but acquitted,¹ the black lots being changed by miracle
to white in the urn (XV. 1-59)]. At Heraclea Pythagoras, exiled ·
from Samos, instructs him in the doctrine of metempsychosis,
and the law which forbids all shedding of blood. This was
unknown in the golden age, but began with the slaughter of
animale for food (75-142). Pythagoras - recalling his own former
existence as Euphorbas (slain by Menelaus before Troy)—teaches
that all life incessantly passes from one to another form·; all things
ato in flux and change - the heavenly bodies, the seasons types of
human lise, the elements with their transmutations‚ the vast changes
oti the face of the earth (237-277). [These changes detailed:
wntrrr that disappear‚ or overflow regions once dry; islands formed

nna„ mutand, and plains uplifted into uther spirans alfwld?
