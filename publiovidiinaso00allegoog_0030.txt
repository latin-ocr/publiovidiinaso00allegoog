TO

THE “METAMORPHOSES ” OF OVID.

ΤΗΕ Mythology os the Greeks, adopted by the Romans,
consists mainly of two distinct parts. The first is what is techni-
cally called Theogony, “the generation of the gods,'’ and was
put in the shape best known to us by Hesiod, some time before
500 rac. lt began, there is no reason to doubt, with rude personi-
fications os the objects and forces of nature, such as would be
natural to a people of active intelligente, lively imagination, and
childlike ignorance on all matters os science. The sun, the
Dawn, the Winds, the Floods, are easily conceived as superhuman
persons. Some os tbe earlier fables are hardly any thing more
than metaphora or poetic images‚ put in the form os narrative.
That the Sun is figured as a shepherd, and the fleecy clouds his
lldck, which are scattered by the wind and gathered again by his
beams, -a very old bit of Eastern poetry‚ -— easily gives rise to the
stories of Apollo as the shepherd os Admetus, and that which tells
the stealing of his cattle by the rogue Hennes. That the maiden ‘
Artemis gazes with love on the sleeping prlnce Endymion, ls hardly
more than a poetical way ol describlng the beautiful spectacle of
arun moon rising opposite the sun at hls going down. A season
os blasting drought and beat may have been described by saying
that the chariot of the Sun was driven from its course by the
unskilful, sels-confident boy, whose fate ls told in the wild tale of
Phaethon. And soon.
