[Ducarvrrtc the daughters os Pelias, Jason's enemy, by a
similar miracle wrought upon an aged ram, Medea brings about
their father’s death (Vll. 297-349).- Escapin'g by means ol winged
dragous, and passing over ,the scene ol many transformatione,
Medea comes to Athens3 whence (her attempted poisoning of
Theseus ⁴being loiled by the recognition of his father AEgeus) she
suddenly vanishes (350—424). A feast is celebrated in honor of¹
Theseus' exploits 3 and hostility ensuing with Minos (Europa’s son)
os Crete, Cephalus is sent as envoy to· AEgina; to whom the aged
AEacus relates the marvellous transformation o'f ants to men (called
Myrmidons), after his realm had been ravaged by pestilence (425-.
660). Now Cephalus had received from his wife Procris a bound
and a dart that never missed its aim; and, as he delighted greatly
in hunting, Procris being jealous watched him from a thicket3 and
he, taking it lor the movemeneof some wild creature, shot her with
that dart which was her own gift (661-865). Minos, making wa'r
on Athens to avenge the slaying of his son' Androgeos, comes first
to Megara; where Scylla, daughter of the king Nisus, out os love
lor Minos cuts the purple lock on which her father's kingdom and
lise depend„ Disdained by MinoS, she is changed to a sea-men,
and Nisus to an osprey (v111.1‚-151).]

Theseus, in his escape frorn the Cretan labyrinth, had borne
away Ariadne, daughter os Minos; who, forsaken by him, is com-
lorted by Bacchus, who sets her coronet among the stars (152-182).
Daedalus, builder of the labyrInth, being imprisoned, escapes with
his son Icarus by means ol wings fastened with wax; but Icarus,
soaring too near the sun, and the wax melting, falls into the sea
named for him (183-234). His sall is gladly seen by Perdix, once
sister’s son to Daedalus, and slain by him out of envy, but changed
by Mineria to a partridge (ης-259).

ΟΤΑ ]ονί Minos taurorum corpora centum

solvit, ut, egressus ratibus, Curetida terram
contigit, et spoliis decorata e'st regia lixis.
'creverat opprobrium generis, foedumque patebat ¹53
matris adulterium monstri novitate bilorrnis.
