[Boou X.-86-219.]

WITHDRAWN apart from the love of women, and having
gathered by his song a grove of forest trees [among them the pine
which was once the youth Attis, and Cyparissus changed by Apollo
into a Cypress], Orpheus sings of the loves of the gods for mortal
men. And first of Ganymede of Troy, borne to heaven by Jupiter
in the form oi an eagle (143-161); and of Hyacinthus, a beautiful
youth of Sparta, beloved by Apollo but accidentally killed by him
with a discus (or quoit) that he had hurled into the air; from
whose blood sprang the flower that bears his name (162-219).

[He further sings of certain people of Cyprus, cruel to
strangers, who by Venus were changed to oxen (220-237); of the
statue wrought by Pygmalion, which became a living maiden, and
his bride (243-297) 3 of Myrrha, who because of her incestuous love
of her father became a tree weeping fragrant gum (298-502) 3 of her
child Adonis, loved by Venus (5035 59) ; of Atalanta, fleet of foot,
who was won in the race by craft of Hippomanes with three golden
apples, but both were afterwards changed into lions (560-707);
and of the death of Adonis, slain by a wild boar, and by Venus
converted into the flower Ammona, as Menthe had aforetime been

by Proserpine into the herb Mint (708-739).]

COLLIS erat, collemque super planissima campi
area, quam viridem faciebant graminis herbae.

umbra loco deerat: qua postquam parte resedit

dis genitus vates, et fila sonantia movit,

umbra loco venit. Non Chaonis afuit arbor, 90

non nemus Heliadum, non frondibus aesculus altis,
