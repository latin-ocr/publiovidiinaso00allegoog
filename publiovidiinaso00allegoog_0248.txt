XI. 101.] Bacchus in Phrygia. 107

XVII. Tun Sronr oo Mrnns.

[Boon XI.-85-193.]

Pnocnnmwu from Thrace into Phrygia, Bacchus is deserted by
Silenus, whom king Midas restores to him, and so receives from
Bacchus whatever boon he should desire. Choosing that whatever
he touched-might become gold, Midas presently finds his gift a
curse3 but by help of the god is freed from it on bathing in the
river Pactolus, whose sands thenceforth become gold (85-145).
Afterwards‚ frequenting woods and lonely places, he became
witness ofa contest for the palm of music between Pan and
Apollo. By Tmolus, the mountain-god, Apollo is judged victor3
and Midas pronouncing for Pan, his ears are by Apollo lengthened
into ass’s ears (146-179); the secret of which being by his servant
whispered to the earth, there sprang up reeds‚ which in their
rustling told the shame of Midas (180-193).

NEC satis hoc Baccho est: ipsos quoque deserit

agros, ι

cumque choro meliore sui vineta Timoli
Pactolonque petit-quamvis ἠοη aureus illo
tempore, nec caris erat invidiosus arenis.
hunc assueta cohors satyri bacchaeque frequentant,
at Silenus abest. Titubantem annisque meroque 90
ruricolae cepere Phryges, vinctumque coronis
ad regem duxere Midan, cui Thracius Orpheus
orgia tradiderat cum Cecropio Eumolpo.
qui simul agnovit socium comitemque sacrorum,
hospitis adventu festum genialiter egit
perbis quinque dies et junctas ordine noctes.

Et jam stellarum sublime coegerat agmen
Lucifer undecimus, Lydos cum laetus in agros
rex venit, et juveni Silenum reddit alumno.
huic deus optandi gratum, sed inutile, fecit
muneris arbitrium, gaudens altore recepto.
