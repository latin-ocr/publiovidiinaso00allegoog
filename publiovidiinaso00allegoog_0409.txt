186 Notes: Ovid. [Mareu.

all cases where there are words of more than two syllables; for
thus a short syllable will often serve as a key to the entire structure
of the verse.
F or exampleS, we will take the first four lines of the poem.
1. In nova fert dnz'rnus mntdlas dicere formas.
Here the last three words are scanned exactly as they read:
multatas Ι dicere Ι fdrmas. Of the others, Animus shows by its
accent that the i of the penult is short; and, as its last syllable
must belong to the following word, nothing more is needed to show
that the verse will scan as follows : —
ln ndvai Ι fert anllmus ΙΙ multatas Ι dicere Ι formas;
and the quantity of the other syllables is shown at once by their
position in the verse.
2. Corpora: Di, coeptis-nam vos mutastis et illos—
The first word corpora, being a dactyl, at once gives a correct start to
the verse. The second foot, Dr'coep--is equally plain, as a spondee;
and alter this beginning, the rest of the verse scans of itself : -
Corpora: Ι Di, coepltis ΙΙ -nam Ι vos multastis et Ι illas.
3. Adspirate meis,· primaque ab origine mundi.
The first word, adspirate, is nearly as clear, as, when we remember
either the pronunciatien of adspfro or the quantity of the rr of the
first conjugation, we see that it contains three long syllables, a
spondee and the beginning of a dactyl. The last three ieet are
pronouneed exactly as in prose (observing the elision) τ -
· Adspibate melis3 ΙΙ priimaqu’ ab dlriglne Ι mundi.
4. Α d mea pnrpltunm dedncite tempora carmen.
Here the three last words form a perfect metrical series; aud the
only difficulty in the verse is caused by the r'ctus coming ou ue
first syllable of perpetuum, while the accent is on the second.
Ad mea Ι perpetnlum Ι deldflclte Ι tempora Ι carmen.
These directions would be sufficient for all or nearly all cases}
ii it were not for the frequent elision of the last syllable of wordsz
viz., in general, whenever a word ending in a vowel or in ruis
followed by a word beginning willa- a vowel or wilh h. This
makes the commonest and most annoying of the obstacles to be
met, and requires the beginner to be constantly on the watch. Ii
he will now carefully compare the following lines, as metrically
divided‚ with the rules which have beengiven above, it is hopel
that he will have little difficulty hereafter.
