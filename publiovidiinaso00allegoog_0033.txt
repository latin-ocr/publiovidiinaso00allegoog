4 Introduction.

is apparently the first attempt of human thought to deal systemati-
cally with the phenomena of nature-so aS, in a manner, to
account sor things-before men were sufficiently free from super·
stition to reject the early fables. The titles of several Greek works
of the same kind are known; and Virgil, in the Sixth Eclogue,
puts a similar song into the mouth of Silenus.

Any thing like a real belief in these sables had passed away long
before the time os Ovid. He was the popular poet oia sensual
aud artificial age, who found in these creations of ancient lancy
a group of subjects suited to his graceful‚ ornate, and marvellously
facile style os narrative, and who did not hesitate to alter or dress
them up to suit his purpose. The “ Metamorphoses '³ -Lr'brr’ xv.
Metamorphoseon (a Greek genitive)-is the most abundant and
rich collection of these lables that exists. They are told in a
diffuse, sentimental, often debased way, which contrasts strongly
with the serious meaning that originally belonged to these myths ;
but are wonderfully fluent, easy, and melodious in their language, and
show a skill of versification which seems never to halt or weary.
The poem begins with the first origin of things from chaos, the
four ages of gold, silver, bross, and iron, the deluge, followed by the
graceful and picturesque version of the tales os gods and heroes,
through a long narrative-about 12,ooo verses in all—ending
with the apotheosis oi Caesar, as the sequel of the tale of Troy.
The series purports to be chronologica13 but the order is often
arbitrary and the connection forced or affected, as would naturally
be the case with an author res dr'versrlrsimas inspeciem unius

corporis collrgentem (Quint. iv. 1, 77).
The mythology of Ovid and the other Roman poets was Greek

mythology dressed up in Roman names. lt is not necessary to
remind the reader that ⁶the storics here told related ‚to Zeus,
Athene, Artemis, and the other members of the Greek Olympus,
and could never have been attributed to the sober abstractions of
the Roman Pantheon. Nevertheless‚ in commenting upon Ovid,
it is impossible to avoid making use of the names in the same
sense that he did-the names long familiar in modern litera-
ture, which took them from the Romans and not the Greeks.
