PROEM(1-4). Descriptiones Chaos (5-20). The Creator assigns
the elements to their places, and divides the land from the waters:
the zones and climates (26-58). The heavens are clear, and living
things come forth upon the earth: lastly man, fashioned by Prome-
theus in the image of the immortals (69-88). The Four Ages:
description of the Golden Age (89-112). The Age of Silver. Brass,
and Iron: Astraea quits the earth; the Giants, and men of violence
that sprang from their blood (113-162). Jupiter recounts the crimes
ol Lycaon, and his transformation to a Wolf (163-243). He re·
solves to drown the world with a F lood rather than destroy it by
Fire: description of the Deluge (244-312). The righteous Deuca-
lion with his wife Pyrrha: when the waters are abated, they behold
the earth desolate, and beseech aid at the shrine ol Themis
(313-380). Instructed hythe oracle, they cast stones above their

heads, which are miraculously converted into human beings, and

IN nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas
corpora. Di, coeptis (nam vos mutastis et illas)

,adspirate meis, primaque ab origine mundi
ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen.

ΑΝΤΕ mare et terras et (quod tegit omnia) caelum,
unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe,
quem dixere Chaos: rudis indigestaque moles,
necquicquam nisi pondus iners, congestaque eodem
non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum.
nullus adhuc mundo praebebat lumina Titan, xo

nec nova crescendo reparabat cornua Phoebe,
