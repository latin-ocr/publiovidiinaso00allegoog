Pyramus arrd Thisbe. [Maean.

V. Peninus ano Tursan.

[Boon IV.— 55-166.] ’

[OF the family of Cadmus, Actaeon, having beheld Diana as
she was bathihg with her nymphs, was changed by her into a stag,
and torn in pieces by his own hounds (ΙΙΙ. 138-252). Semele
became the mother of Bacchus but was destroyed by the presence
of Jupiter, whom she desired to see clothed with flames and thunder
(2 ς 3-31 5). Tiresias, the Theban seer, is made blind, but endowed
with prophecy (316-338). The nymph Echo, pining with love of
Narcissus, becomes a-roclr, her voice alone surviving (339-401);
while Narcissus, gazing on his image in a sonutam, perishes, and
by the water-nymphe is converted to a flower (402-510). Pen··
theus, having denied the god Bacchus, and forbidden his solem·
nities, and caused him to be seized‚ is torn in pieees by Bacchanals,
his mother and sisters aiding: Bacchus meanwhile (in the form of
Acaetes) relates the miracle wrought by himself upon a Tyrrhenian
crew, whose ship’s tackle he had converted to serpents, and them-
selves to dolphins (511-733). Three Theban sisters (Minyeides)
likewise refrain from the rites of Bacchus: of whom one relates the
tale of Pyramus and Thisbe (IV. 1-54)].

These young lovers, dwelling in Babylon, had appointe'd a
meeting at the tomb of king Ninus (55-92). Thisbe, coming
first, is terrified by a lion and so escapes. PyramuS, soon arriving,
finds tracks of the beast and the torn mantle of Thisbe ; and con· ⁴
ceiving that she is slain, stabs himself with his swerd, his blood
reddening the fruit of the mulberry, at whose foot he lies (93-127).
Thisbe, soon returning‚ finds him dying, and slays herself with 'the
sword yet warm (128-166).
