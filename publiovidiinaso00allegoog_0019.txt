vi The Life of Ovz'd.

the emperor at some weakness, folly, or fault, which he says
he is not free to tell. Some have thought he was indiscreet
enough to make love to Julia, the brilliant, witty, and erratic
daughter of the emperor, wife of the grave Agrippa3 others
that he unfortunately knew too much ,of some court scandal,
probably connected with Julia or her ill-famed and ill-fated
daughter; others that Augustus, as public patron of morah,
took offence at the somewhat cynical indecorum of certain
of his poems. At any rate, ‚the emperor was hardened
against all his flatteries and prayers, and after an exile of
about ten years he died at Tomi, A. n. 18.

Besides the poems represented in this volume, Ovid was
the author of the Ars Amatoria and the Remedium Amoris
(to which reference has just been made), and of numerous
“Elegies,'' including four books of letters written in exile
(Ex Ponto Libri iv.). As a poet, his fame is far below that
of Virgil and Horace, - deservedly, since his loose and easy
verse bears no comparison with the elaborate finish of theirs.
For fancy and fine poetic feeling, however, many ot the
Elegies- both in the Tristia and the Amores- show a vein
of as good quality as either of his rivals; while in absolute
ease of handling the artificial structure of Latin verse it may
be doubted whether he has ever had an equal. His chief
merit, however, is as an excellent story-teller,—smooth,
facile, fluent, sometimes, it must be confessed, inordinately
diffuse. As the most celebrated existing collection of the
most famous fables of the ancient world, the Metamorphoses,
in particular, makes the best of introductions to the nobler
and more difficult verse of Virgil.
