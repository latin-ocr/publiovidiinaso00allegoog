[Boox IX.—134-272.]

[AanLous continuing the discourse, tells of the transforma·
tions oi Proteus; and of Metra, daughter of Eresichthom who
(receiving this power from Neptune) long, by cheats and wileS,
sustained her father cursed with extreme rage of hunger sor the
violation of a grove of Ceres (VIII. 725-884). And as Theseus
inquires the cause of his broken horn, Achelous replies tlrat con·
tending once with Hercules for the possession of Dejanira‚ sister
- of Meleager, that horn had been wrested off, and, being filled by
the Naiads with autumn fruits, became the horn of Plenty (lx.
1-100). ln delence of the same Dejanira‚ Hercules had once
slain the centaur Nessus; who, dying, gave her a tunic stained
with his blood, mixed with venom of the Lernaean hydra, which (he
said) would recall her husband’s love if ever it should wander or
cool (ror-133).]

Afterward‚ Hercules being about to wed Iole, daughter os Eury-
tus, Dejanira sent to him this tunic as a marriage gift But when
it took beat from the altar flames as he was about to sacrifice, Her·
cules, being in extreme torment, and unable to tear it off, cast into
the sea the bearer of the gift, LIchas, who was converted into a
rocla retaining his human form (134-227). Then Hercules, build-
iag a great funeral pile upon Mount OEta of Thessaly, burned him-
self thereon; and, his mortal parts being purged away,¹ was
received into the company of the gods (228-272).
