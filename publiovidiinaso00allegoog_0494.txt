The Poet's Autohiography¹ 271

68. fabule, scandat.

78. lunula: as the lustrum is generally rechoned at five years,
this would make his father ninety at the time of his death (but see
below, note to o. 95).

80. iusta, due (funeral) rites.

8 5. aliquid ulei, something besides.

88. ln Stygio foro, in the court of Pluto.

95. ortus, birth. -Pieaea oliva: the reward to the victor in
the Olympic games (held in the territory oi Pisa) was a crown of
wild olive. As these games came once in four years, decies victor
would naturally mean forty years ; he was, however, fifty at the time
oi his banishment, and we can account sor the discrepancy only by
supposing that he reckoned the Olympiad at five years, an almost
inconceivable blunder. Mommsen explains it, however (Rhm.
Chron. p 170), by calling attention to the confusion of the ancients
themselves in regard to the expression quinto quoque anno, ior the
period in the Julian calendar: “the poet,’' he says, “rightly sup-
posed that the Olympiad and the Julian lustra [decem lustris perac-
tis, lbis. 1], were of equal length, and very wrongly supposed the
latter to be five years.”

97. ad laeva, i. e. as one sails out {rom the Propontis (Mar-
mora).
