(Bostom Giun Brothers. leiti-This volume is in keeping with the high
character os the editors' previous publications. It is not too much to say,
that with the appearance of their “Latin Grammar,” in 1872, began a new
era iu the stndy of the Latin language iu Amerien, and perhaps there is no
more encouraging token ol the condition of classieal scholarship among us
thau the cordial and intelligentweloome so generally exmnded to this ad·
vaneed manual. Their cditlon of ‘⁴ Seleeted Oratione ol Cicero '’ in 187³
was superior to any which the American student had before hod. A prac-
tieal application oi the best results of Latin scholarship aad ol general
philology, and a clear conciseness of statement, preeminently characterized
both works, and these are the qualities which give to this edition of Virgil
its great merit. The wealth of comment which has accumulated about the
language and thought-s of their author the editors seem to have thoronghly
examined, without, however, sacrifieing a practical aud independent spirit
peculiar to themselves. Wherever a diligent learner would be likely to
have doubts as to Virgil's exact meaning, οι· to be puazled by the idioms or
subtleties of the Latin, there the editors appear with ample help, or, nt least,
with'aclue to the solution. We have been particularly plensed with the
synopses of thought which precede and accompany each portion ol the
poema.

We are using Allan and Greenough’s Latin Grammnr, and lind it ample
in amount, clear in statement oud arrangement, suggestive ol' higher studies
in the same field, und easy to eitc,-in short, an excellent school grammar.

From Albert 0. Perklns, masto murenae High, reeently

We have used Allen and Greenough’s Latin Grammar during the past
year with great satisfaction. It answers excellently all the pnrpvoses of a
school-book, and inmishes much matter not previously aceessible to most
pupils. It seems to mo to mark a deeided advenae in Philology, and to
meet well all the wenta oi our preparatory school&
