' Ἰ. Trea Fnsan

Τιιδ word fasti, properly applied to those days of the year on
which it was permitted (sas) to transact public business, came to
be applied to the Roman calendar, or systematic arrangement
and classification of thedays of each month. Ovid's purpose in
this poem was-to cast'this calendar into a poetic form, describ·
ing whatever πεδ 'peculiar a'nd characteristic ιιι the Roman· usag es,
-as festivals and rites‚ -and working' rnto it whatever traditions '
and myths were current among the people. The Roman religion
was so 'meagre in the elements of sablo, that rts mytholog y', as pre-
sented ιιι this work, rs hardly more than a clumsy adaptation and
vamping over of. Grecian myths. It -was, however, as rich' ιιι
form and ceremonial„as it was poor in story 3 ‚and the most valu-
able and original portions of the Fasti are those which describe
fragments of these primitive rites‚ which had managed to survive
theinroad of theniore- fashlonable Greek and Oriental forms of
worship, and'still'lingered in the -community. Some o'f them,
indeed, held their own for centuries longer, and some were
transformed and adopted into the Christian calendar.¹

Only' δικ books of the Fasti ,containing the months ftom Jan-
uary to June inclusive, are extant. tt rs a much disputed question
whether the other srx books have been lost, or were never written.
It' ιδ probable thatthey. were written ιιι the rough, but unfinished
at the time of the poet's exile, and never published. At any rate,
there are no citations' ιιι ancient authors from any but the first
six books·

The following extracts from the fourth book (April) cont ain a
description of two very ancient festivals, with the traditional
account of the founding of Rome, introduced ιιι the usual manner,
of the poet

1.1Tlve Festinat ofPans (Aprn ιι).
