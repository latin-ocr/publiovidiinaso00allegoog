THE LIFE OF OVID.

Μ

Purnrus Ovmrus Naso was a fashlonable poet at Rome

in the reign of th'e Emperor Augustus, perhaps the most '

fashionable after the death ot Virgil (u. c. 19) and Horace
(uc. 8).

All that is worth knowing about his' life is told by himself
in apleasing poem (Trist iv. 10), which is given the last in
the present collectiori. Like most of the literary men of
Rome, he was not a native of that city,* being born at Sulm0,
in the country of the Peligni, about 90 miles from Rome.
The year of his birth, Β. e. 43,<was that of Cicero's death
His father, a man of respectable fortune, removed to Rome
to give his two boys a. city education. Here the young poet
was trained in the usual course of rhetoric and oratory‚ which
he practised with fair success, going s'o far as to hold some
subordinate political offices. His father was quite eamest to
check his desire for a literary career. But the death oi his

elder brother left him with fortune enough for independenec,
and following his own strong bent Ovid became soon one

of the favorite court poets of the brilliant eraol Augustus.
After a career of great prosperity, he was suddenly, at the
age of 51, banished to Tomi, a town on the shore of the ,

Black Sea, in th'e present Bulgaria, The cause ol his banish- .

ment can only be guessed from his allusions to the anger of
